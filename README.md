## The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for writing good, maintainable code. Here is a Simple explanation with exemples of each principle in the context of Swift:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Keep your Swift classes focused on a single task or functionality. Just like a tool in a toolbox is designed for one job, each class should have only one reason to be updated or changed.
  
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Your Swift classes should be like building blocks. You can add more blocks to create new structures (extensions) without needing to change the original blocks (modification). This encourages building upon existing code without altering it.
  
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that if a program expects a certain behavior (like a universal remote controlling any TV), any subclass (like EcoTV) should comply with those expectations. If the subclass behaves unexpectedly (EcoTV turns off when changing channels), it violates LSP because it can't be used as a drop-in replacement for the expected behavior.

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Just like choosing only the TV channels you like, in Swift, create specific protocols for specific needs. Don't force a class to conform to a protocol with methods it doesn't need.
  
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): DIP advises that systems (like a SmartHome System) should rely on abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations (specific TV models). This means designing the system so it can work with any TV that follows the agreed interface, making it adaptable to different TV brands without requiring changes to the system itself.
